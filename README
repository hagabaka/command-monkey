Command Monkey
--------------

Overview
========

Command Monkey is a Ruby library to work with interactive command-reply
programs. Such programs display a prompt to the user, expect command input, and
display a reply, followed by the prompt again. For example, irb and pacmd.

Command Monkey provides an interface to such programs, so you can call a Ruby
method to send a command and get its reply as the return value. It keeps the
program running in the background, so your own program can do what it needs,
and call commands at any time.


Synopsis
========

  require 'command-monkey'

  # Run the program 'irb', whose prompts match /irb.*>/
  irb = CommandMonkey.new('irb', /irb.*>/)
  irb.command('1+3') # => expect '4'
